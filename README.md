I am an undergraduate student at Brown University interested in improving usability of computer systems. Currently, I work with Prof. Deepti Raghavan, Prof. Akshay Narayan, and Prof. Will Crichton on improving reactivity in computational notebooks. I was also advised by Prof. Nikos Vasilakis on introducing automated aggregators to shell script parallelization systems. Beside research, I enjoy teaching and course dev for software engineering, computer networks, and Chinese.

In my free time, I like to read (+ write about what
I read), learn Japanese, visit cafes, go to the gym with my friends, and maintain my 200+ day streak on Leetcode.

Thank you for reading about me :D! I would love to meet you too => [megan_zheng@brown.edu].
